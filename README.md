## Game Rules
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game for two players. The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a cell in the grid with their symbol (either "X" or "O"). The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all cells are filled and no player has aligned three symbols, the game is a draw.
